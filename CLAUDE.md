# CLAUDE.md — rssr agent guide

---

## Keeping This File Current

**Update CLAUDE.md whenever you:**

- Add, rename, or restructure a module or directory
- Change a module's sole responsibility
- Add a new persisted type or data file
- Change the testing workflow
- Establish a new non-negotiable rule
- **Change the task workflow or caveman mode behavior**

Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` whenever you change the state machine, keybindings, App struct shape, or any design detail a
human would want to reference.

**Do not let CLAUDE.md drift from the code.** If you notice a stale reference (wrong file path, removed type, changed
rule), fix it in the same commit.

---

## Task Workflow

1. **On session start**: read `TASKS.md`. Pick up the highest-priority incomplete item.
2. **Priority indicators**: tasks marked with [!] are high-priority. Always prioritize these before non-flagged tasks
   within the same category.
3. **Pick up work**: always take the highest-priority incomplete item first.
4. **If anything is unclear**: stop and ask the user. Do not assume scope, layout, or behavior. Just ask directly in
   your response.
5. **On completion**: move item from its category to **Completed** with a timestamp (e.g.,
   `[2026-04-12 14:35] - Task name`).

**Blocked entry format** (required fields):

```
- **<Task name>** — <one-line summary>
  Question: <exact question to ask the user>
```

**Before marking any task done**: run the full test workflow (below) and confirm the requirement is met.

## Module Rules (non-negotiable)

| Module       | Does                                         | Never does                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `models/`    | Type definitions + display-only impl methods | Any I/O, logic, rendering           |
| `app.rs`     | App struct fields + navigation methods       | I/O, rendering, key handling        |
| `storage.rs` | Disk I/O only                                | Network, rendering, state mutation  |
| `fetch.rs`   | Async network I/O only                       | File I/O, rendering, state mutation |
| `handlers/`  | Key routing; mutates App; spawns tasks       | File I/O (calls storage), rendering |
| `ui/`        | Ratatui rendering only                       | State mutation, any I/O             |
| `main.rs`    | Bootstrap + MPSC dispatch                    | Business logic, rendering details   |

- **`ui/` draw functions are pure** — `&mut App` is only for Ratatui widget state (e.g. `content_line_count`). Never
  call `save_*` or mutate logical state inside a draw function.
- **All disk writes go through `storage.rs`** — no `std::fs` calls anywhere else.
- **All network calls go through `fetch.rs`** — no inline `reqwest` in handlers.
- **All new shared types go into `models/`** — never redeclare a type in another module.
- **`impl` blocks on model types belong in `models/feed.rs`** — only display helpers (no I/O).
- **`app.rs` navigation methods only** — `next()`, `previous()`, `select()`, `unselect()`, tab switching.

## Feature Checklists

See `CHECKLISTS.md` — read it before implementing new types, AppStates, keybindings, background tasks, or persisted
data.

---

## Commit Discipline (mandatory)

Every commit must be **atomic** — one logical change per commit. Never bundle unrelated changes.

| Type | What belongs together |
|------|----------------------|
| `feat:` | Only the source files implementing that feature |
| `fix:` | Only the files containing the bug fix |
| `docs:` | Only documentation/config files (CLAUDE.md, README, etc.) |
| `chore:` | Only task tracking files (TASKS.md) |
| `test:` | Only test files |

**Split before committing** — if you changed src files AND docs AND TASKS.md, that is at minimum 3 commits.
Never combine a `feat` or `fix` with `docs` or `chore` in one commit.

---

## Testing Workflow (mandatory before reporting done)

```
cargo check     # zero errors
cargo test      # all tests pass
cargo clippy    # zero warnings
cargo run       # visual verify of the affected feature
```

Never report a visual feature as done without running the app.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mutating App logic inside `ui/`** — draw functions are pure rendering only.
- **`std::fs` outside `storage.rs`** — all file access goes through storage.
- **`.await` in the event loop** — always use `tokio::spawn`; the loop must never block.
- **Hardcoding `Color::Rgb(...)`** — use the named constants in `ui/mod.rs`.
- **Forgetting `#[derive(Debug)]`** on new public types.
- **Adding a dep for a single utility function** — use stdlib or an existing dep.
- **Not updating CLAUDE.md or ARCHITECTURE.md after a structural change.**
