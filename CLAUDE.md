# CLAUDE.md — rssr agent guide

---

## Keeping This File Current

**Update CLAUDE.md whenever you:**

- Add, rename, or restructure a module or directory
- Change a module's sole responsibility
- Add a new persisted type or data file
- Change the testing workflow
- Establish a new non-negotiable rule
- **Change the task workflow or caveman mode behavior**

Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` whenever you change the state machine, keybindings, App struct shape, or any design detail a
human would want to reference.

**Do not let CLAUDE.md drift from the code.** If you notice a stale reference (wrong file path, removed type, changed
rule), fix it in the same commit.

---

## Task Workflow

1. **On session start**: read `vault/wiki/INDEX.md`, navigate to relevant nodes as needed, then read `TASKS.md`. Pick up
   the highest-priority incomplete item.
2. **Priority indicators**: tasks marked with [!] are high-priority. Always prioritize these before non-flagged tasks
   within the same category.
3. **Pick up work**: always take the highest-priority incomplete item first.
4. **If anything is unclear**: stop and ask the user. Do not assume scope, layout, or behavior. Just ask directly in
   your response.
5. **On completion**: move item from its category to **Completed** with a timestamp (e.g.,
   `[2026-04-12 14:35] - Task name`).

**Blocked entry format** (required fields):

```
- **<Task name>** — <one-line summary>
  Question: <exact question to ask the user>
```

**Before marking any task done**: run the full test workflow (below) and confirm the requirement is met.

## Feature Checklists

See `CHECKLISTS.md` — read it before implementing new types, AppStates, keybindings, background tasks, or persisted
data.

---

## Commit Discipline (mandatory)

Every commit must be **atomic** — one logical change per commit. Never bundle unrelated changes.

### Commit types

| Prefix      | Use for                                                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat:`     | New user-visible behaviour or capability                                         |
| `fix:`      | Bug correction (logic, crash, wrong value)                                       |
| `ui:`       | Visual/layout changes with no behaviour change (colours, borders, spacing, text) |
| `refactor:` | Internal restructuring with no behaviour change                                  |
| `perf:`     | Performance improvement                                                          |
| `test:`     | Adding or fixing tests only                                                      |
| `docs:`     | Documentation files only (CLAUDE.md, README, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)              |
| `chore:`    | Tooling, CI, dependency, config — nothing a user would notice                    |

### Splitting rules

- **File-level**: if a single file contains hunks of different types, use `git add -p` to stage only the relevant hunks
  for each commit.
- **Minimum commits per session**: one per type touched. Changing a handler (fix), its rendering (ui), and CLAUDE.md (
  docs) = 3 commits.
- Never mix `feat`/`fix`/`ui`/`refactor` with `docs` in one commit.

---

## Testing Workflow (mandatory before reporting done)

```
cargo check     # zero errors
cargo test      # all tests pass
cargo clippy    # zero warnings
cargo run       # visual verify of the affected feature
```

Never report a visual feature as done without running the app.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mutating App logic inside `ui/`** — draw functions are pure rendering only.
- **`std::fs` outside `storage.rs`** — all file access goes through storage.
- **`.await` in the event loop** — always use `tokio::spawn`; the loop must never block.
- **Hardcoding `Color::Rgb(...)`** — use the named constants in `ui/mod.rs`.
- **Forgetting `#[derive(Debug)]`** on new public types.
- **Adding a dep for a single utility function** — use stdlib or an existing dep.
- **Not updating CLAUDE.md or ARCHITECTURE.md after a structural change.**
